# Welcome to the Powerful Trio - Tailwind CSS, Vue 3, and Flowbite Starter (Vite) - Dark Mode

Eager to kickstart your web application development journey? This dynamic starter project, which weaves together the best of Tailwind CSS, Vue 3, and Flowbite, is just the ticket! We've designed this repository with reference to the insightful [Tailwind CSS + Vue guide](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/vue/) over on the Flowbite website.

## Your First Steps in Setting Up

Before embarking on your adventure, make sure Node.js is set up in your project. Get all the dependencies aboard with a simple command:

```
npm install
```

Next, it's time to compile and bundle the source code. Just a quick command away:

```
npm run dev
```

To build the project and see your efforts come to life, run:

```
npm run build
```

It's time to unlock the power of [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com) components! You can bring them into play by importing and initializing the objects using the `onMounted` method.

### Empower Your Project with Data Attributes

You can make interactive components come alive by importing the "init" functions from the Flowbite package, using the `onMounted` lifecycle method from Vue 3. 

Here's a friendly guide on initializing components with Vue 3:

```javascript
/* Code snippet */
```

Want to initialize all components in one go? `initFlowbite` is your friend. However, for a breezy, fast-loading experience, we recommend initializing only the components you frequently use.

Check out the [starter guide's](https://github.com/themesberg/tailwind-vue-starter) `Events.vue` file for a closer look at this in action.

### Making Magic with the JavaScript API

To blend the charm of Flowbite's interactive components with Vue 3 and Tailwind CSS, import them inside your Vue files. You can initiate the object based on the `onMounted` method from Vue.

Here's a friendly guide on using the Modal component:

```javascript
/* Code snippet */
```

We've made sure these will seamlessly work with tools like Vue Router by using the `onMounted` method to set up the event listeners after the templates have loaded.

Here's the necessary HTML markup that you need to add inside the `<template>` tag:

```html
/* HTML snippet */
```

Discover more examples tucked away inside the `views/` folder. For a deep dive into available methods and options for the Flowbite API, make a beeline for the "JavaScript Behaviour" section on each page of this documentation.

## The Upcoming Star - Flowbite Vue Library

Exciting times are ahead! We're knee-deep in crafting a dedicated [Flowbite Vue library](https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-vue). Upon its grand debut, this will be your go-to library for using our components with Vue 3, purposefully built for the Vue 3 environment. 

Progress has been fantastic, but we reckon it'll be a few more months until a stable release. We're all ears for any contributions you'd like to make!

## Licenses and Legalities

Fear not, this project is open-source and fully bathed in the light of the MIT license. Happy coding!
